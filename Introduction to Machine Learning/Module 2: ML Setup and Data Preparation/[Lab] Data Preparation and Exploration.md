Check the rubric below to see the number of points each TODO is. The majority of the TODOs will have multiple parts and you will receive points for completing each part of the TODO. Some TODOs will have multiple parts but in order to receive any points you will need to complete the entire TODO! 

Lastly, all TODOs will be graded based on the completion of the entire TODO. Partial points will ONLY be given for multi-part TODOs (these TODOs are indicated when a range of points is available in the rubric)!
