[Resources] Data Visualization and Exploration
Overview
Once our problem is formulated and we have some data to work with, it's time to visualize and explore our data. Data visualization might not be the first thing you think of when you here machine learning, it is actually a crucial aspect in understanding your data. Without this understanding of our data, we won't be able to make sure our assumptions about our data corresponds to the inherit assumptions are machine learning algorithms are built-upon!

Remember that No Free LunchLinks to an external site. theory which essentially says that there is no "best" ML algorithm for all problems? Recall that the only way to get around this problem is to make assumptions about algorithms! As it turns out, most ML algorithms are created based on a set of inherent assumptions (varying depending on the algorithm used). For instance, linear algorithms make the assumption it is modeling data with linear trends! Violating this assumptions means the algorithm is likely to perform poorly or might completely fail to learn anything!  Meaning, if we use non-linearLinks to an external site. data to train a linear algorithm, the predictions are likely to be bad as a linear algorithm can learn/model the non-linear trends in the data.

Thus, in order to pick an algorithm we need to make sure our assumptions about our data match with the assumptions made inherently by the algorithms we choose (e.g., linear algorithms assume linear trends are contained in the data). The only way to make any assumptions about our data is through prior/expert knowledge and knowledge gained from data visualization and exploration! Further, data visualization can help us to discover data that might need to be cleaned or transformed during data preprocessing (more on this soon).

To start off, let's take a look at what data visualization entails and some examples of how to visualize different types of data. While the below videos provide a high-level view of data visualizations, in the lab we'll take a look at some actual visualizations like histograms (to observe distributions) and scatter matrix plots (to observe correlations) and what insights we can gain from these plots.
