ML Setup and Data Preparation
Overview
In this module we'll be taking a look at the high-level layout of the end-to-end machine learning process. In particular, we'll be focusing on the initial stages which revolve around data preparation rather than the machine learning models. We'll define data preparation to include things such as the following:

Formulating our problem
Gathering data
Exploring and visualizing data
Preprocessing data
There is a popular meme/cliche in the machine learning, and data science community at large, that roughly 80% of your time is typically spent performing some sort of data preparation (data collecting, cleaning, or visualization) while roughly only 20% of your time is spent working on machine learning algorithms and model fine-tuning.  It also turns out that data preparation is often considered the least "fun" aspect of being a data scientist or machine learning practitioner.

While data preparation can be quite a headache at times, enjoyment of data preparation is actually largely based on the problem and data you are working with so don't get discouraged quite yet! Sadly, there is no avoiding data perpetration even if it isn't "fun", as we'll see, it is simply too important to skip!

As data preparation consumes such a large potion of most data science practitioners time, we'll try to to cover the basics in this module but also continue to reinforce and build on the ideas presented here throughout the semester. Keep in mind, data preparation can be extremely specific to your problem and there's no way we can cover all data preparation techniques while also covering the basics behind many different machine learning algorithms.
