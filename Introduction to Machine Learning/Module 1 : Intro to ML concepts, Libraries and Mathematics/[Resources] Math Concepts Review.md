[Resources] Math Concepts Review
Overview
Below are a lot of videos and readings that cover some very important math concepts we will be using throughout the course. Right now, these math concepts might seem random and disjoint, but I promise you every math concept talked about here is crucial to implementing and understanding the most basic machine learning algorithms and theory!

As mentioned, there is a lot here. Your goal, for now, should be to go through quiz and refresh yourself on concepts you don't remember and/or are struggling with. The labs in the coming weeks will try to hit upon many of the mathematical ideas and we'll see how they translate to ML. That being said, if you find yourself confused about a particular concept throughout the semester, come back to this section and review. There is a lot to go over and remember, so don't feel like you need to understand all these concepts fully right now! This section aims to prepare you and provide you with a glance at what kind of math will popup throughout the semester.
