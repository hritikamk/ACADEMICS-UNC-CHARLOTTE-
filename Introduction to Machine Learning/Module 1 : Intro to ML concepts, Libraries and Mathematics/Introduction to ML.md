Introduction to ML
Overview:

Machine learning (ML) is a collection of computation methods which uses data (or experience) to learn how to predict, act in the world, and form new representations among other things. Rather than "hard coding" rules that aim to solve a problem, like traditional programming,  ML learns the "rules" needed to solve a problem by analyzing data and extracting patterns that enable it to perform well. This is extremely useful when problems are too complex to solve in the traditional programming manner. Instead of solving it directly, we can train an algorithm to solve the problem by simply providing data where each data samle is often (but not always) labeled which the "correct" answer or desired output. Now, let's take a  look at the video to gain a better understanding about the following points:
