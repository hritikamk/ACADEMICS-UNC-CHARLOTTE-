[Resources] Generalizing to Multiple Layers
Please read the corresponding section in the notes called Implementing Multi-Layer Neural Networks.  There are no videos here, however below are some optional additional resources.

 

 Deep Learning chapter 6Links to an external site.
Covers the basics of neural networks including the general algorithm for computing the backwards pass. This chapter is much more in-depth than we go and uses slightly different notation than we have seen.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning chapter 2Links to an external site.
This chapter covers the general idea of implementing back propagation for multiple layers. Notation use is similar to ours, however the algorithm we use for backpropagation focuses on computing the update for all neurons in a layer at once.
