In Aim 1, you have implemented how to use KNN to classify ECG signals. However, KNN is such a simple method, so let's try some more advanced algorithms and maybe more interesting datasets. 

 

Objective
The primary goal of this capstone project is to develop an in-depth understanding of state-of-the-art methods in ECG-based classification. By reading recent papers, selecting an algorithm of interest, implementing it, and critically analyzing its performance, students will strengthen their research and technical skills in biomedical signal processing and machine learning.

TODO
Literature Review
Select and thoroughly read at least three research papers related to ECG-based classification. You can search these papers in Google Scholar. 
Focus on understanding the problem addressed, methodology, and contributions of the selected work.
Algorithm Implementation
Select at least Two Papers and reimplement the method proposed in the papers. Let's call them Method A and Method B. 

Option 1: Implement the algorithm from scratch.
Option 2: Use the code provided by the authors (if available) and modify or analyze it as needed.
(Ensure your implementation can adapt to the ECG5000 dataset.)
Document your implementation process and any challenges faced.
Evaluation
Evaluate the algorithmâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity).
Compare the performance of your Methods A and B with KNN (you can call it Method C).
Report Writing [Document to Submit]
The recommended structure of the report contains:

Title, Date, Your Name

Literature Review

List all the papers (at least two) you've read. Include the Authors, title, journal/conference, year.
For each paper, provide a paragraph description of your takeaway message (e.g., summarize it, describe your inspiration, the drawbacks of it)
Methods 

Details of the Method A and Method B
Provide the overall framework figure to implement them
Do you have any data preprocessing? If so, describe how you did
Experiments

Test your methods and show the results with some discussions
Were you able to reproduce the paper's experiments? Are the results identical? If different, why does it happen? 
Are the performance of Methods A &B are better than KNN or not, analyze potential reasons. 
Do you have your experiments with other data? If so, share your observations and analysis to it.
Share your thoughts about the results and discuss what you think about the model and the solution
[Important] Conclusions and Discussion
What's your unique contribution in this capstone project? For example, you reimplemented a method proposed by other researchers, you applied a new algorithm that nobody used in this domain, you created a new dataset, you build an online system to make it live, etc.
What conclusion you can draw based on your experiments and observations
What are the drawbacks of all the existing methods, and what are the potential solutions?
What are the future research directions?
Sharing agreement
This is a new capstone project, I don't have an example for you, but your work could be used as an example for the next semester.  
Do you agree to share your work as an example for next semester? 
Do you want to hide your name/team if you agree?
You are fine to say "no" if you don't want.  
 

The final report is a writing assignment with complete citations and references. 

Make sure to proofread before the final submission.
