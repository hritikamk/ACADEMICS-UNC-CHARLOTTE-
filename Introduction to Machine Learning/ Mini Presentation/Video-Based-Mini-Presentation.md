Video-Based-Mini-Presentation
Due 13 Apr by 23:59 Points 100 Submitting a file upload
To encourage self-education and help the student to have a deeper understanding of the basic concepts in the machine learning area,  along with developing the ability to effectively communicate an ML topic to peers,  we will have this mini-presentation. This is a group assignment where each group has 5 students. However, the members in the same group may have different grades. Each team member's grade will be modified by the peer-assessment of their individual contribution. More details in Grading part below.

Groups have been formed, with each group comprising five students. Please check your assigned groups under the "Mini-pre-group" tab in the "People" section.

Submission:

This year, due to the large enrollment, we don't have enough in-class time for all the presentations  (it will take 4 weeks if we do in-class presentations). So it will be video-based (no in-person presentation). Please submit the following files on canvas (you may zip them into a single file): 

1. Slides for your 20-mins presentation (no less than 10 pages, no more than 20 pages)

2. Video of presentations. Please upload a video of around 20 mins length. Each group member should participate in the presentation (each one for ~4 mins). In your video, please make sure it includes the slides you are presenting, and a small or floating window of the presenter (in real-time)! You can record videos with simple tools such as zoom. 

3. In-group Peer-Review Form. Review the members in your group. See the instructions at the end of this page.

Please submit a zip file containing all the above three files. The slides and videos could be identical within a group. 

Instructions:

Choose a topic from the fundamental machine learning concepts.
You can also choose a topic that is not included as long as it's related to machine learning.
The topics of different groups cannot overlap. If a topic is selected by one group, other groups cannot select this topic again.
Some topics are obviously more difficult, bonus grades could be given (decided by the instructor).
Here is a list of presentation topicsLinks to an external site., please discuss with your teammates and fill in the group number to the cell after the topic. For example, 

Topics	Groups
Overfitting	Group 5
Normalization	Group 9
Conduct research on your topic using broad online sources (e.g., blogs, tutorials, research papers, books, and public courses). 
Create a PowerPoint presentation that effectively communicates your topic. Your presentation should be around 20 mins. 
It's suggested that each group member present for around 4 mins, the total presentation is 20 mins.
Guidelines:

Your presentation should be well-organized and easy to follow. Use headings and bullet points to structure your content.
Your presentation should be visually engaging. Use images, charts, and diagrams to support your content.
Your presentation should be delivered with confidence and enthusiasm. Practice speaking clearly and with good volume.
Your presentation should be supported by credible sources. 
Your presentation should be respectful to your peers. Avoid offensive or inappropriate language or imagery.
 

Grading:

Your presentation will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correctness: The degree to which the presentation reflects an accurate understanding of the chosen topic and the relevant course material.
Completeness: The degree to which the presentation covers all important aspects of the chosen topic and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
Presentation: The degree to which the presentation is engaging, clear, and well-organized, with good use of visual aids and effective delivery. 
Each criterion ranges from 1 to 10. The scores will be averaged as the final grade. 

The presentations will be graded by the instructor and TAs. Extra points may be awarded to excellent presenters!

In-group Peer-Review:

To assess the contribution of your group members, please download this form (ITCS5356Presentation-In-group-peer-review-GradingForm.xlsxLinks to an external site. ) and review your team members. The peer-review grade is from 1-10. The averaged peer-review grades will be used as a weight to modify the group grade to each team member grade. For example, Group 0 got 10 marks for their presentation; Alice got 8 marks in the in-group peer-review after averaging all the team members: the final grade for Alice in this assignment will be 8 = 10* 0.8
