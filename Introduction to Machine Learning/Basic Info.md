Course Overview
Machine learning has been successfully applied to many different areas such as autonomous control of cars and robots, natural language processing, image recognition, health science, biology, and data mining. This course aims to introduce fundamental concepts and methods for using data to learn! This course covers focuses on supervised learning, however there are other areas of machine learning we will not get to such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The primary focus of this course is applying machine learning techniques to various problems and data while also exploring other aspects of data science such as visualization and data pre-processing. In this course, you will learn

how to read and work with data in various formats
how to visualization data
how to utilize different popular Python machine learning libraries
how to apply/implement different machine learning methods from scratch
how to provide an analysis for machine learning results
The main topics that will be discussed in class include linear regression, polynomial regression, regularization, linear classification, naive bayes, logistic regression, neural networks, and deep learning.

Course Objectives
By the end of the course, you should be able to: 

gain a high-level understanding of various machine learning algorithms,
perform basic preprocessing, loading and visualization techniques on data,
apply different machine learning approaches to different problems/data,
understand the basic theory of machine learning,
navigate and utilize popular Python machine learning libraries.
Class Format
This class will be formatted as a flipped/active learning class where my hope is to provide a top-down approach where you learn through practicing concepts rather than a bottom-up approach which is typically done by lecturing about theory and concepts. This means that the majority of lectures, notes, and readings will be done before coming class. In class, we will focus on reviewing and practicing concepts through labs. This means class time provides you a chance to practice the concepts you learned about!

Prerequisites
While this course aims to not get tied down in the mathematics of machine learning there is also no escaping the mathematics in order to implement and begin to understand how most machine learning algorithms work. Thus, I highly recommend that you at least be familiar with the very basics of linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and probability theory. Programming-wise, it is recommended to have programming experience with Python.

 

Python programming skills are needed for this course as most of all labs and assignments are based on Python (running on Jupyter Notebook). 

Required Items
For each class you are required to bring a laptop. We'll be doing in class labs every week and you'll need access to a laptop to run code and complete the lab assignments!

Optional Books
We don't have a mandatory textbook. Here are some optional materials, read if you are interested in them.
