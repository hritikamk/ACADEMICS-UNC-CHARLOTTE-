This assignment was locked 11 Apr at 22:59.
Objective: In this assignment, you will work with your new team members to address problems identified in your last week's reviews of the Splitwise app. Collaboratively, you will select 2-3 problems. If they are medium/large problems, you should work on 2 of them; if they are smaller problems, you should work on 3. For each problem, you will brainstorm at least two different solutions and create wireframes that go beyond visual differences and item placement on the screen. You can use one of the two tools provided in the class prep material for wireframing.

Instructions:

Part 1: Problem Selection

Share Your List: Share your individual list of the top 3 problems identified in your last week's reviews of the Splitwise app with your team members.

Team Discussion: As a team, discuss the problems each of you brought to the table and choose 2-3 problems to focus on. Consider whether these problems are smaller issues or medium/large challenges.

 

Part 2: Solution Brainstorming

Brainstorming Session: Collaboratively brainstorm at least two different potential solutions for each of the selected problems. Encourage open discussion and creative thinking. Each team member should contribute ideas.

Evaluate and Select: Evaluate the brainstormed solutions for each problem and select the most promising ones. Ensure they address the identified problems effectively.

 

Part 3: Wireframing

Wireframe Creation: Using one of the wireframing tools provided in the class prep material, create wireframes for the selected solutions. Ensure that your wireframes go beyond visual differences and item placement. Focus on interaction, functionality, and user experience.

Differences and Features: Annotate your wireframes to highlight the key differences and features that address the identified problems. Make sure your solutions are clearly articulated.

 

Part 4: Submission

Submit a report that includes the following sections:

Section 1: Problem Selection

List the 2-3 problems your team selected. Specify whether they are smaller or medium/large problems.
Section 2: Solution Brainstorming

Describe the brainstorming process and the solutions considered.
Explain why the chosen solutions were selected.
Section 3: Wireframes

Include the wireframes for the selected solutions.
Annotate the wireframes to highlight differences and features that address the problems.
 

Grading: Your assignment will be assessed based on the selection of relevant problems, the creativity and viability of the proposed solutions, the quality and clarity of your wireframes, and the effectiveness of the annotated wireframes in explaining how the solutions address the problems.
