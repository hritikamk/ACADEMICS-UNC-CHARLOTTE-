Tools:

Choose one of the following tools. Adobe XD is recommended as you can also use it for high-fidelity prototyping and it is free while Balsamiq is simpler but only gives you a 30-day trial. If you choose to work with Balsamiq make sure to export all your work as PNG or JPEG files before your free trial ends. Make sure to review the tutorials for the tool that you choose so you are ready to use it for your in-class and project work.
