After reviewing the prep work material for session 6, it is time to practice them with an activity. 

 

Step 1:

Go to

Expedia.comLinks to an external site.

Search for an international vacation destination of your choice and try to plan an imaginary vacation that includes flight, hotel, etc. 

 

Step 2:

Think about your interaction with the Expedia website throughout this process and review the interaction of the website by making specific feedback from Jakob Nielsen's heuristics perspective:

Visibility of system status
Match between system and the real world
User control and freedom
Consistency and standards
Error prevention
Recognition rather than recall
Flexibility and efficiency of use
Aesthetic and minimalist design
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Help and documentation
 

Step 3:

Share your feedback on the above heuristics by creating a report that includes marked screenshots, specifying each heuristic, and your point of view on how the design is successfully or unsuccessfully following that heuristic.  

 

Step 4:

Submit your document for this assignment before the assignment deadline. 

 

Note: If at any point during the process, you find any of the listed heuristics above unclear, search for further clarification. You can also use the class discussion forum to initiate a conversation and ask for examples and explanations Outside of the website that I have assigned for this activity and get help from your classmates and TAs for better understanding.
