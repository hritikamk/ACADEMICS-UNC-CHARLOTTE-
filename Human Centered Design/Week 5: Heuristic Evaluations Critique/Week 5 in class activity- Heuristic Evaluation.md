Duration: 65 minutes

Objective:

To perform a comprehensive heuristic evaluation of the UNC Charlotte Admission & Financial Aid webpage and three of its subpages. Identify usability and design issues, both positive and negative, using Jackob Nielsenâ€™s usability heuristics.

 

Step 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

Understand the purpose of this assignment: to conduct a heuristic evaluation of the Charlotte.edu website and assess its usability and design based on ten recognized usability heuristics.

 

Step 2: Website Selection (5 minutes)

Visit the Charlotte.edu website and select three subpages within the site that you will evaluate.

 

Step 3: Heuristic Evaluation (40 minutes)

Use the ten usability heuristics and guidelines introduced in the course to evaluate the selected pages.

Assess the usability and design of each page, looking for instances that align with each heuristic (positive instances) and instances that violate each heuristic (negative instances).

Create a separate subsection for each of the ten heuristics in your report.

 

Step 4: Reporting (5 minutes)

Prepare a report summarizing your heuristic evaluation. Organize your report as follows:

For each heuristic, create a subsection in your report. In each subsection, provide:
A description of the heuristic.
Positive instances where the heuristic is followed correctly in the design.
Negative instances where the heuristic is violated in the design.
Recommendations for improving the design based on the identified issues.
 

Step 5: Submission (5 minutes)

Submit your report document on Canvas. Each member of your group should submit individually although your reports will all be the same document.
Ensure you submit it before returning to the main session.
 

Step 6: Sharing and Discussion (5 minutes)

Prepare to share your findings and recommendations with the class, focusing on key observations and insights related to the usability heuristics.
