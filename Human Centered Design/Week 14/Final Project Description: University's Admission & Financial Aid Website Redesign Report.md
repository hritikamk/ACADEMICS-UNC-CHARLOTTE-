Report structure

Introduction:

The goal of this project is to comprehensively report on your university's Admission & Financial Aid website redesign activities. Your report should showcase the iterative design process, starting from the design critique phase to the creation of high-fidelity prototypes.

 

Chapter 1: Design Critique Learnings:

Summarize the insights gained from various design critique activities. Detail the critique methods used for each identified issue, including visual design critique, interaction design critique, and heuristic evaluation. This chapter should include clearly marked and labeled screenshots for easier navigation and understanding of your critiques.

 

Chapter 2: Main Personas and Interviews:

Introduce your 3 personas, highlighting the main persona chosen for the redesign. Provide details on your interview process, covering recruiting methods, interview questions, and a summary of the key learnings from the interviews, and make sure the learnings are reflected in your main persona. Include a separate subchapter to explicitly state the needs identified as a result of your interviews.

 

Chapter 3: Top Three Needs and Design Ideas:

Discuss how you selected the top three needs or goals based on cumulative learnings from interviews and critiques. Elaborate on the ideas generated to address these needs, and include wireframes to illustrate your design concepts. Only include one solution per identified need, a total of three solutions & wireframes as you will be discussing the top three needs that you identified.

 

Chapter 4: Usability Testing:

Include your usability testing plan. This should outline the participant recruitment criteria and method (i.e. who did you target to recruit and how did you plan to find them), the test goals, session duration, the tasks assigned during usability testing, and the follow-up questions. Include a sub-chapter to present the findings from the testing phase. Describe any changes made to the design based on usability test outcomes.

 

Chapter 5: High-Fidelity Prototypes and Changes:

Provide screenshots of your high-fidelity prototype, explaining the evolution from low to high fidelity based on usability tests. Detail the changes made, emphasizing improvements and refinements to address identified issues.

 

Chapter 6: Interactive High-Fidelity Prototype:

Attach the interactive high-fidelity prototype to your report. Include instructions on how to navigate and interact with the prototype.
