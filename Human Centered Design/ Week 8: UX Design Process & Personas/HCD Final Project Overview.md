As we move into the second half of the semester, it is time to go over an overview of your semester project.

 

Individual Project:

In the upcoming weeks, a significant part of your focus will be directed towards an individual project. This project will involve improving our university's website design based on the class's previous and upcoming learnings. This project will give you a chance to apply the principles we've learned and contribute to enhancing the user experience of a real-world website.

 

Project Scope:

We aim to make meaningful improvements to our university's  Admission & Financial Aid website. The minimum expectation from this project is to:

Address the design issues previously identified by you and your teammates during our design critique activities.
Effectively identify new opportunities and needs as we learn about the UX design process.
Address a part of the needs and opportunity areas discovered during UX design process.
 

Building Blocks:

Just like the first half of the semester, each week, you'll be submitting assignments focused on the university's website. These submissions are not standalone tasks; they are also your project building blocks. They will contribute to the foundation of your final project report. It's important to put effort into creating quality reports for these weekly submissions because they will shape the overall quality of your project.

 

Engage with TAs:

Remember that the expectation for your final project is higher than the weekly assignments as the assignments are your practice opportunity. Keeping that in mind, I strongly encourage you to engage with our Teaching Assistants (TAs) during their office hours. They are here to support you, provide guidance, and offer feedback on your project as it progresses. You do not have to wait for grades to be published before seeking feedback. Don't hesitate to reach out to your TAs for feedback; their input can be invaluable.

 

Final Project Deadline:

The final project report will be due on the last session of our class, which is prior to the exam period. Keep this timeline in mind and work gradually, seek feedback, and make necessary revisions so you have most of your work ready moving towards the deadline.
