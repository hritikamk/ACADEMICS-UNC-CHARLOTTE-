Review Problem Statements: Go back to the problem statements you created in the last project milestone. Ensure that they are clear, specific, and focused on addressing issues within your persona's context.

Persona Alignment: Revisit your persona's characteristics, needs, and pain points. Ensure that the problem statements align with your persona's profile.

 

Part 2: Solution Ideation and Wireframing

Ideation: For each of the problem statements, brainstorm 2-3 distinct ideas or approaches to address the problem. Consider innovative solutions that go beyond surface-level changes.

Wireframing: Using the wireframing tools introduced in previous sessions, create wireframes for each of the ideas generated for the problem statements. Ensure your wireframes address interaction, functionality, and user experience, not just visual design.
