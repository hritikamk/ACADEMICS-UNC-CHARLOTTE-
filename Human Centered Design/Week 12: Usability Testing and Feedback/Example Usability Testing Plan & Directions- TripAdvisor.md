** We will demo a usability testing session based on this plan in the beginning of the class

 

The purpose of this document is to outline the details and objectives of the usability testing session.

 

Session Duration:

The usability testing session will last approximately 30 minutes per participant.

 

Recruiting:

Participants will be recruited based on the following criteria:

Must be individuals who have not previously visited or are not familiar with Nashville.
Should have an interest in travel and exploring new destinations.
Shouldn’t be regular users of Trip advisor
 

Goal of the Testing:

The primary goal of this usability testing is to evaluate how users interact with the TripAdvisor website when planning an unexpected trip. We will focus on learning from users’ behavior when:

Exploring an overview of the possibilities in the city
Exploring top things to do and select one
Exploring top places to visit in the city and select one
 

We aim to identify any usability issues, gather feedback on the user experience, and understand how easily users can discover and explore information about Nashville attractions.

 

Facilitator instruction [For your learning, this part is not included in a usability test plan]

Follow a script and try to stay as consistent as possible between your participants.
Open up the session with welcomes and introductions, share what the goals are, how much time you will take from them, what the compensations are if any, and if you will be taking notes or recording.
Do not make the participant feel judged. Remind them the session is about evaluating the product, not them, and there is no right or wrong way of doing things
Ask the participants to think out loud so you can hear the thought process behind their actions and decisions. You might have to explain to them how to do so
Avoid interrupting participants as much as possible, you might have to remind them to think out loud but stay away from interrupting them beyond that
Never tell a participant to do things differently or argue over their opinion. You are not there to defend the product or correct their actions.
Try to both record the session and take notes on the side. You can also ask someone to help you with taking notes.
When taking notes think about data that is meaningful and helpful to you. That includes things the participant was confused about, their errors and what they did that was unexpected, if a step of a task took them more time than expected, their comments, and frustrations.
Wrap up the session with some questions to gather more details on the events and their experience. Ask follow-up questions if needed.
