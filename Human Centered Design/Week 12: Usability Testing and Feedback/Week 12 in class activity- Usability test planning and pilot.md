Objective: 

To ensure the effectiveness of your upcoming usability testing and gather feedback from your peers. You will draft a usability testing plan similar to the provided example and conduct a pilot of your plan with a fellow team member. The goal is to identify any issues or improvements needed in your instructions before conducting the actual usability test. Remember, this is not your actual test. It is just a practice run!

 

Instructions:

Part 1: Draft your individual usability testing script (20 minutes)

Draft a usability testing script to test the low-fidelity wireframes you have created for the university website. You can use the template shared in class today as a base for your script. Make sure that you script targets to test the design that you have put together and is appropriate for your target persona (similar persona that you selected for the interview phase)

 

Part 2: Inform Your Partner About Your Persona

Pair Up with a Team Member: Each student will paired with another team member for the pilot usability test. You will each act as both the facilitator and participant during this exercise.

Share Persona Information (6 minutes, 3 minutes each): 

Each student should briefly inform their partner about the persona they selected for the test. This should include the persona type, high-level demographics, and overarching goals. Avoid discussing the persona's pain points and detailed needs at this stage.

Listen Actively: As you receive information about your partner's persona, actively listen and make mental notes. This will help you simulate the persona effectively during the pilot usability test.

 

Part 3: Pilot Usability Tests (30 minutes- 15 minutes each)

Conduct the Pilot Usability Test: As the facilitator, follow the test plan you prepared during part 1. As the participant, respond to the questions as if you were the selected persona.

Feedback Exchange: After the pilot session, switch roles. Provide constructive feedback to your partner about their test plan, structure, and any issues you encountered.

Take Notes: Both participants should take notes during the pilots, highlighting what worked well and what needs improvement.

 

Part 4: Usability Test Plan Revision

Review Feedback: Based on the feedback received from your partner, consider what changes or improvements are needed in your usability test plan

Revise Your Usability Test Plan: Make the necessary revisions to your plan based on the feedback. This could include refining tasks, questions, adjusting the session structure, or adding new prompts.

Explain Changes (1-2 paragraphs): In your report, include a section where you explain what changes you made in the revised version of your test plan and why you made those changes.

 

Part 5: Submission

Submit a report that includes the following sections:

Persona: Include a copy of your target persona for grading reference
Starting Usability Test Plan: Include the Usability test plan that you drafted during part 1.
Pilot Usability Test Experience (1 paragraph): Describe your experience conducting the pilot test.
Feedback Received (1-2 paragraphs): Summarize the feedback you received from your partner during the pilot usability test.
Revised Usability Test Instructions (Include Revised Instructions): Share the revised version of your usability test instructions.
Explanation of Changes (1-2 paragraphs): Explain what changes you made in the revised version and why you made those changes.
Each member of your group should submit individually. Note that you will have a completely different report from your teammates for this assignment.

 

Grading:

Your report will be assessed based on the effectiveness of the usability testing instructions, the effectiveness of the revisions made according to received feedback, and the clarity of your explanation of changes. This assignment is crucial for refining your usability testing process before conducting actual sessions.
