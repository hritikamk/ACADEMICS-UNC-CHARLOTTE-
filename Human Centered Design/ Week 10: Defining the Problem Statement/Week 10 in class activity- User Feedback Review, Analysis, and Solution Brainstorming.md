Objective: In this assignment, you will explore user reviews of the Splitwise expense-sharing app, analyze them to identify common themes and design problems, prioritize issues, and brainstorm potential solutions for the most critical problems.

 

Instructions:

Part 1: App Exploration

Install Splitwise (5-10 minutes): If you don't already have it, install the Splitwise expense-sharing app on your phone.

Use the App (5-10 minutes): Spend a few minutes exploring the app's features. Try adding an expense, creating a group, or any other feature that interests you. Familiarize yourself with its functions.

 

Part 2: App Review and Analysis

Read User Reviews: Visit the provided link to read 12 of the recent user reviews of the Splitwise app, focusing on reviews with 3 stars or lower. Ensure that these reviews include enough text descriptions of users' experiences.

Group Discussion (45-60 minutes): Form groups with your classmates to discuss the reviews you read. Within your group, focus on the following tasks:

a. Theme and Problem Extraction: Work together to extract common themes and design problems (not bugs or development issues) mentioned in the reviews. Discuss which issues were repeatedly mentioned and which were unique.

b. Prioritization: Collaboratively prioritize the identified issues. Create a prioritized list of the most critical problems. Discuss the reasoning behind your prioritization.

c. Solution Brainstorming: For the top three high-priority issues, brainstorm potential solutions. Discuss ideas and strategies to address these problems effectively.

Section 3: Solution Ideas
