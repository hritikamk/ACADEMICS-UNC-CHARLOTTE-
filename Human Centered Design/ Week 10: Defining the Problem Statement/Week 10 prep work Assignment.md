Assignment: Persona-Updating Interviews

Objective: In this assignment, you will conduct interviews with participants from your target persona group to collect data for updating and refining your personas. These interviews will help you gain insights into your personas' needs, goals, and pain points. You will later use the learnings to revise your personas and decide about the details of your design project. 

 

Instructions:

Part 1: Participant Recruitment

Recruit Three Participants (1-2 paragraphs): Using your specified persona criteria, recruit three participants from your target persona group. Explain how you recruited them, where you found them, and why they match your persona criteria.

Informed Consent (1 paragraph): Ensure that participants are informed that the interviews will be audio recorded. Participants must explicitly consent to being recorded. Provide a brief explanation of the recording process and ask for their consent.

 

Part 2: Conduct the Interviews

Interview Sessions (Three Sessions): Conduct four one-on-one interview sessions with the recruited participants. Use your revised interview instructions from the previous assignment.

Recording (Three Audio Recordings): Ensure that each interview session is audio recorded. You can use an online meeting platform's recording feature or a personal device. Record each session in mp3 format.

 

Part 3: Reflect and Report

What Went Well and What Didn't (1-2 paragraphs): Reflect on the interview process. Describe what aspects of the interviews went well and what challenges or issues you encountered.

Unexpected Learnings (1-2 paragraphs): Share any unexpected insights or findings you gained from the interview sessions. These could be valuable aspects that you hadn't initially considered.

Submission of Audio Recordings: Attach your report as well as the audio recording files for all three interview participants in mp3 format. Label the files clearly with the participant's name or identifier.

 

Grading: Your assignment will be assessed based on your participant recruitment process, the quality of your interview sessions, your reflective report on what went well and what didn't, and the submission of audio recordings.
