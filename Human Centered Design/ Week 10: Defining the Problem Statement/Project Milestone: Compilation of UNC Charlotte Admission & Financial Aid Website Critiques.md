Objective: To initiate your design project and create a foundation for your individual work, you are required to compile all the critiques you have submitted on the university's Admission & Financial Aid website throughout the semester into one comprehensive, summarized list. This milestone will serve as a basis for your upcoming project tasks.

Instructions:

Gather Your Critiques: Review your class assignments and submissions from previous sessions to collect all the critiques you have provided for the university's website. Ensure you have included critiques from each relevant session.

Comprehensive Summarization: Create a summarized list of critiques. Organize them logically and provide a brief description for each point. You don't need to go into excessive detail, but ensure the points are clear and understandable.

Submission: Submit your compiled list as your first project milestone. This should be a single document or report that neatly presents your critiques.

Grading: Your milestone will be assessed based on the completeness and clarity of your compiled list. Ensure that the issues and areas for improvement are well-documented and can serve as a strong foundation for your upcoming design project.
