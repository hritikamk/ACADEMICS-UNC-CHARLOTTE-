Objective: In this assignment, you will conduct usability tests with participants from your target persona group to collect data for updating and refining your wireframes. These tests will help you gain insights into your personas' experience and perspective toward the design that you have created. You will later use the learnings to revise your design and as you create your high fidelity wireframes.

Instructions:

Part 1: Participant Recruitment

Recruit three Participants (1-2 paragraphs): Using your specified persona criteria, recruit four participants from your target persona group. Explain how you recruited them, where you found them, and why they match your persona criteria.

Informed Consent (1 paragraph): Ensure that participants are informed that the session will be video/audio recorded. Participants must explicitly consent to being recorded. Provide a brief explanation of the recording process and ask for their consent.

 

Part 2: Conduct the Usability Tests

Usability Testing Sessions (Three Sessions): Conduct Three one-on-one usability testing sessions with the recruited participants. Use your revised test plan from the previous assignment.

Recording (Thre Audio Recordings): Ensure that each interview session is screen-recorded for your analysis. Also, make sure to audio record the follow-up questions portion of each session to submit aside with this milestone report. You can use an online meeting platform's recording feature or a personal device. Record the follow-up questions portion in mp3 format.

 

Part 3: Reflect and Report

What Went Well and What Didn't (1-2 paragraphs): Reflect on the testing process. Describe what aspects of the tests went well and what challenges or issues you encountered.

Unexpected Learnings (1-2 paragraphs): Share any unexpected insights or findings you gained from the testing sessions. 

Submission of Audio Recordings: Attach your report as well as the audio recording files for all three participants in mp3 format. Label the files clearly with the participant's name or identifier.

 

Grading: Your assignment will be assessed based on your participant recruitment process, the quality of your usability testing sessions, your reflective report on what went well and what didn't, and the submission of audio recordings.
