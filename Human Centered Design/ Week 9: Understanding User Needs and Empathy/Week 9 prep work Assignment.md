Objective:

In the last session, you created proto-personas for the UNC Charlott Admission & Financial Aid website. Now, it's time to gather real data to refine and update these personas. The goal is to make them as accurate and user-focused as possible. In this assignment, you will create interview instructions to conduct persona-updating interviews.

 

Instructions:

 

Part 1: Interview Instruction

 

Interview Type (1 paragraph): Decide on the type of interview you plan to conduct. It could be structured, or semi-structured. Explain why you chose this type and how it aligns with your persona-updating goals.

 

Participant Recruiting Method (1 paragraph): Describe how you will recruit participants for the interviews. This could include where you will find them, what criteria they should meet, and any incentives you might offer.

 

Interview Duration (1 paragraph): Specify the expected duration of the interview. This helps participants know what to expect and ensures you stay within the allotted time for the activity.

 

Interview Questions (List of Questions): Develop a list of interview questions that will help you gather insights into your personas' goals, needs, and pain points. You should aim for open-ended questions that encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences. Focus on asking questions that can give you relevant, and interesting information for your project. Include at least 8 questions. When deciding on your interview questions make surer to follow the guidelines provided in your prep-work video.

 

Part 2: Persona Selection

 

Select one of the proto-personas you created in the previous session. This will be the target persona for your interview.

 

Part 3: Preparing for Interviews

 

Make sure you have the necessary recording equipment or note-taking tools.

Review your interview instructions and persona's goals to ensure your questions are relevant. Try to schedule ahead your interview sessions for early after our next class. You will be collecting AND using your data then.

 

Part 4: Submit Your Prep-work

 

Please submit your interview instructions as your prep work for the next session. This assignment is not about conducting the interviews but preparing the plan to do so.
