Objective:  Identify and analyze real-world examples of good and bad Human-Centered Design (HCD) based on your personal experiences.

 

Brainstorming (5 minutes)

Go over the slides for today's session. You don't need to fully digest them but have a quick look to get an idea of the topic. 
Think about apps, websites, and digital products that you know of or have used.
From those, list examples of good and bad human-centered design that you've personally encountered in your daily lives.
Consider products, services, environments, or interfaces.
Choose two examples from your list: one representing good HCD and one representing bad HCD.
Ensure your selections are based on personal experiences.
 

 Analysis (10 minutes)

Analyze your selected examples:
For good HCD, identify what makes it user-friendly, intuitive, and effective. What aspects of the design contribute to a positive user experience?
For bad HCD, pinpoint the pain points, inefficiencies, or usability issues. What could have been done better to improve the user experience?
 

 Report (10 minutes)

Create a report document summarizing your findings. You can use a word processor, a Google Doc, or any other suitable tool.
Include details about the examples (include images or screenshots to make your examples easy to understand), your analysis, and why you consider these examples good or bad in terms of HCD.
 

 Submission (5 minutes)

Submit your report document on Canvas. 
 

Presentation

During the main session, some groups will be asked to share the selected examples to the class.
Be prepared to explain why you consider these examples to be good or bad in terms of Human-Centered Design.
Be prepared for class discussion and questions after your presentation.
